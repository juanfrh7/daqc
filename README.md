# Data DAQC
This repository provides data related to the Digital-Analog Quantum Computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models in superconducting circuits, including both ideal and noisy simulations.

Overview
We present a digital-analog quantum algorithm designed to simulate the Hubbard-Holstein model, which describes strongly correlated fermion-boson interactions. This simulation is implemented within a suitable superconducting circuit architecture.

As an example, we demonstrate the quantum simulation of a half-filled two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. The results show time-dependent state fidelities exceeding 0.98, confirming the feasibility of our approach for studying the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems.

## Repository Structure
This repository includes the following components:

- data – Contains the raw data from simulations.
- draft_figs_repo.py – Jupyter notebooks for processing raw data and generating plots for Figures 2 and 5 from [1].
